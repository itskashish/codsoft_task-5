Contains Data Science project - CREDIT CARD FRAUD DETECTION

Credit card fraud detection is a critical application of machine learning and data analytics that helps financial institutions identify and prevent fraudulent transactions. Here's a project description for a credit card fraud detection system :

Data Collection:

Gather a dataset containing credit card transaction records.
I have taken it from kaggle.
The dataset should include features like transaction amount, timestamp, merchant information, and whether the transaction was fraudulent or not.

Data Preprocessing:

Clean and preprocess the data, handling missing values and outliers.
Normalize or scale numerical features to ensure consistency.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Perform EDA to understand the distribution of legitimate and fraudulent transactions.
Visualize patterns and relationships within the data to identify potential fraud indicators.

Data Splitting:

Divide the dataset into training and test sets.
Ensure that the proportion of fraudulent transactions is maintained in both sets.

Model Selection:

Choose an appropriate machine learning or deep learning algorithm for fraud detection.
Common choices include logistic regression, random forests, gradient boosting, or neural networks.

Model Training:

Train the selected model on the training data.
The model learns to distinguish between legitimate and fraudulent transactions based on the provided features.

Model Evaluation:

Evaluate the model's performance on the test set using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve.
Focus on minimizing false negatives (fraudulent transactions that are incorrectly classified as legitimate) as they have a more significant impact.

Anomaly Detection:

Implement an anomaly detection mechanism to flag transactions that deviate significantly from the learned patterns.

Real-time Scoring:

Deploy the trained model in a real-time scoring system to evaluate incoming transactions in real-time.

Monitoring and Maintenance:

Continuously monitor the model's performance and retrain it with new data to adapt to evolving fraud patterns.
Update the model as needed to stay ahead of emerging fraud tactics.
